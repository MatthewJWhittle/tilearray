## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `TileFetcher` engine: shared `httpx` client, bounded concurrency, `tenacity` retries (429/5xx, `Retry-After`), and pluggable per-host rate limiting via `ServiceConfig`
- Fetch presets: `XYZConfig.for_openstreetmap()` (OSMF User-Agent + polite limits) and `WCSConfig.for_ea_dsp()` (EA WCS Retry-After / 429 tuning)
- Offline before/after bench script: `scripts/bench_fetch_engine.py` (results in `benchmarks/fetch_engine_bench_results.txt`)
- Optional `on_progress(done, total, request, response)` callback on `create_array` / `load_array`
- WCS 2.0.1 coverage loading via `create_array` / `load_array` and `WCSService`
- XYZ / slippy-map tile support via `XYZConfig` and `XYZService`
- Service registry (`get_service`, `register_service`, `detect_service_type`)
- `create_tile_grid` helper for origin-aligned gridded tile planning
- Offline WCS contract tests with VCR cassettes (EA Lidar DTM)

### Changed

- README Fetch presets: live 64-tile (~5 km) bench (~20 s at ceiling 16 / `max_inflight` 8 → ~14.7 s at ceiling 32 with aligned Dask workers); `compute_thread_pool_size` noted in Public API table
- README Fetch presets: honest Skipton warm-start timings and note that EA ceiling 16 is a tunable safety max
- README and example-sources: fetch preset docs updated for AIMD EA DSP defaults (adaptive concurrency, no fixed 1 req/s cap)
- README and example-sources: fetch preset quick start, Fetch presets section, and corrected EA Lidar CoverageId in examples
- Tile HTTP moved from per-call `requests.get` to centralised `TileFetcher` (`httpx` + semaphore); `fetch_tile` delegates to the shared fetcher
- `respx` moved from runtime to dev dependencies
- Package renamed from scaffold `ogc-array` to `tilearray`; README, CI, and metadata aligned with shipped API
- EA Lidar WCS GeoTIFF decode and non-divisible tile resize for native-resolution tiles

## [0.1.0] - TBD

Initial alpha release focused on lazy WCS- and XYZ-backed xarray arrays.
